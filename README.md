This project simulates some popular games in a casino. When started, the user will see a starting menu that displays their current balance they can gamble plus a variety of casino games they can play. If one of the buttons is clicked, it will take a user to a new window corresponding with the game they chose.
The games:
1. Slots:
   The user has the choice the gamble either $10, $50, or $100. Once the roll button is pressed, 3 symbols will appear on the screen.
   -If all 3 symbols are unique or are all skulls, the user gets nothing
   -If 2 symbols are the same, the user gets +50% what they gambled
   -If all 3 symbols are the same and are not 7s or skulls, the user gets double what they gambled
   -If all 3 symbols are 7s, the user gets triple what they gambled

2. Blackjack:
   The user can gamble any amount of money. Once the deal button is pressed, it will simulate a basic blackjack game. In this version, you can only hit or stand. If you win you get double what you gambled. Otherwise, you get nothing

3. Roulette:
   The user can gamble any amount of money. This is not completely how a traditional roulette table works. The user can place their desired money on a color and/or a number. Users can place money on multiple tiles. Once the spin button is pressed, the wheel will randomly select one section containing a color and a number.
   -If the user correctly guessed the color, they recieve +50% what they gambled
   -If the user correctly guessed the number, they quadruple what they gambled
   -If the user incorrectly guessed the color or number, they recieve nothing


The user can play any of these games in any order and it keeps going until the user decides to quit, or their balance reaches $0. The goal is to cash out with the maximum amount of money.
